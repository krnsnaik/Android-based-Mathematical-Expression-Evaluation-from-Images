# Android-based-Mathematical-Expression-Evaluation-from-Images

Optical character recognition (OCR) is an important technique for solving many technical problems. As a few examples, OCR has been used for digitizing books, identifying license plates, and assisting the vision impaired. In this report, we propose to develop an Android mobile application that uses OCR to recognize and evaluate arithmetic expressions. The app could be used to help students check their solutions to challenging problems quickly and easily.

# Goals
 - For our initial scope, we plan to focus on recognizing digits (0-9) and basic mathematical operators (+, -, x, and /), and displaying the computed result on the deviceâ€™s viewfinder.
 - Finally, we will improve the app to recognize and evaluate integration and differential equations.
